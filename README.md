# Machine-learning-project
Rock vs. Mine Prediction Using Sonar Data
The project demonstrates the end-to-end data analysis and modeling process using Python, leveraging supervised learning algorithms.
Dataset
The dataset used is the Sonar Dataset, commonly available on Kaggle or the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Features: 60 attributes representing sonar signal frequencies.
Target: Binary classification - R (Rock) or M (Mine).
